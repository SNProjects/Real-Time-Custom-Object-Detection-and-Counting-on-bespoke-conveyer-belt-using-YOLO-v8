## :innocent: About the Project
Training a deep neural network using the latest version of YOLO, i.e., YOLO-V8 to detect custom objects on a conveyer belt. The model also counts objects of each category as they pass on along the conveyer belt. 

## :warning: TechStack/framework used

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- <!-- - [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381) -->


## Use cases of the project
This project can be used for custom object detection and counting in any manufacturing unit using just a functioning camera and a conveyer belt. By training the model on the manufactured products, a given number of products belonging to a specific category can be packaged together. This would make the product counting and packaging tasks in an industry more efficient and robust.
